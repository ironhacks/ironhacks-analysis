# IronHacks Analysis

## Introduction

This repo has the following research questions. 

Research Question 1: What is the individual and joint effect of performance and solution transparency? 


Research Question 2: When and how much do designers explore their designs' form and functionality as they evolve them?

## Data Used



## Experimental Setup 

**Spring 2017**

165 software engineering students are in the randomized control trial experiment. The students are randomly assigned into four treatment groups. In addition, seven students who did not make the first submission were disqualified from the contest. 3,600 is the total prize distributed to the participants, with 500 dollars for the best solution winner, 250 dollars for the second place winner, and 150 dollars for the third place winner. The incentive scheme is designed in alignment with prior literature \parencite{boudreau_open_2015}. To reduce the source of variability in terms of programming skills, we recruit only software engineering students in their senior year from a university in Colombia for this experiment. 

158 students qualified and completed the 5-staged contest. 37 students are in the no transparency group (control), 38 students are in the performance transparency group (only scores of other participants are visible), 41 students are in the solution transparency group (only solutions of other participants are visible), and 42 students are in the full transparency group (both scores and solutions of other participants are shown).


**Fall 2017**

Our empirical study is focused on mash-ups, interactive forms of web applications that contain maps and charts. They create user value by offering functionalities allowing users to examine complex data visually. We designed an experiment with a 5-phased design process, in which designers had to develop novel mash-ups useful for the end-user. The participants consist of senior software engineering students trained in web design. 108 carefully sampled participants of the same skill level produced 540 apps.
